# About The Project
Welcome to the [Typewritten Text](https://github.com/hues0s/TypewrittenText) iOS Kit!

In the past, before voice acting was widely used, text in video games would appear on the screen as if it was being typed out. This added a sense of realism to the dialogue, as it mimicked the natural pace of speech by revealing the words gradually.

Nowadays, this technique is still used in some contexts. For instance, ChatGPT from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) uses type-on text to give the impression of spoken conversation when no actual voice is present.

This Swift Package, built entirely with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/), is a great way to implement the effect on your iOS projects.
